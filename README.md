# MavenMarket-PowerBI


This project was created as a bonus assignment after completing the Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence course on Udemy.

As part of the course, I gained hands-on experience in data modeling, data cleaning, visualization, and analysis using Power BI. The course emphasized extracting meaningful insights from data and effectively communicating them to stakeholders through interactive dashboards and reports.
In this project, I built dynamic dashboards that provide key insights into:
1. Revenue trends 📈
2. Performance of various product brands 🏷️
3. Sales across different store locations 🏬


The project showcases my ability to work with real-world data, leveraging Power BI’s features to create visually compelling and data-driven reports.
